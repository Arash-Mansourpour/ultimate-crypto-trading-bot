- **On-Chain & Social Metrics**: Integrates real-time on-chain data (e.g., active addresses, transaction counts) from Glassnode and Santiment, alongside social sentiment analysis from Twitter (X) and Reddit using VADER.
- **AI-Powered Signals**: Generates buy/sell/hold signals with confidence scores, entry/exit points, stop-loss, take-profit, position sizing, and risk-reward ratios using machine learning (Random Forest) and backtesting (Monte Carlo simulations).
- **Volume & Order Flow Insights**: Includes Volume Profile (POC, VAH, VAL), Order Flow (Delta Volume, CVD, VWAP), Market Microstructure (order book depth, spread), and volatility models (Historical, GARCH).
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects harmonic patterns (Gartley, Butterfly), chart patterns (Head & Shoulders), and candlestick formations for enhanced predictive accuracy.
- **Multi-Timeframe & Correlation Analysis**: Supports MTF alignment across 1h/4h/1d/1w and BTC correlation for holistic market views.
- **User Customization**: Profiles for experience level, risk tolerance, and account size to tailor signals and risk management.
